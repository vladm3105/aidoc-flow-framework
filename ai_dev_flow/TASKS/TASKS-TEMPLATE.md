## 10. Implementation Notes

### 10.1 Design Considerations

#### Architectural Patterns

**Pattern Selection**:
- **Hexagonal Architecture**: Isolate business logic from infrastructure concerns
  - Core domain in `src/[module]/domain/`
  - Ports (interfaces) in `src/[module]/ports/`
  - Adapters (implementations) in `src/[module]/adapters/`
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstract data access behind interfaces
  - Define repository interfaces in domain layer
  - Implement concrete repositories for database, cache, external APIs
- **Service Layer**: Orchestrate business workflows
  - Services coordinate multiple repositories and domain objects
  - Keep services thin, business logic in domain models

**Integration Approaches**:
- **API Client Pattern**: Encapsulate external API calls
  - Retry logic with exponential backoff
  - [SAFETY_MECHANISM - e.g., rate limiter, error threshold] for fault tolerance
  - Request/response logging with correlation IDs
- **Event-Driven Communication**: Use pub/sub for async operations
  - Publisher publishes domain events to topics
  - Subscribers process events independently
  - Dead letter queue for failed message processing

**Scalability Patterns**:
- **Stateless Services**: No local state, all state in database/cache
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Add instances to handle increased load
- **Caching Strategy**: Redis for frequently accessed data
  - Cache-aside pattern with TTL
  - Cache invalidation on write operations
  - Fallback to database on cache miss

#### Technology Choices

**Language & Framework**:
- **Python 3.11+**: Modern Python with type hints
- **FastAPI**: High-performance async web framework
- **Pydantic**: Data validation and settings management
- **SQLAlchemy**: ORM for database access
- **Alembic**: Database migrations

**Data Storage**:
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary transactional database
  - Connection pooling with pg_bouncer
  - Read replicas for read-heavy operations
- **Redis**: Caching and session storage
  - Redis Cluster for high availability
  - TTL-based eviction policy

**Communication**:
- **Google Cloud Pub/Sub**: Async messaging
  - Topic-per-domain pattern
  - Message deduplication with idempotency keys
- **gRPC**: Inter-service synchronous communication
  - Protobuf for schema definition
  - HTTP/2 multiplexing for efficiency

**Observability**:
- **Google Cloud Logging**: Centralized logging
  - Structured JSON logs
  - Correlation ID propagation
- **Cloud Monitoring**: Metrics and alerts
  - Prometheus-compatible metrics
  - SLO-based alerting
- **Cloud Trace**: Distributed tracing
  - OpenTelemetry instrumentation
  - 1% sampling rate

#### Algorithm Approaches

**Core Algorithm Implementation**:
- [Description of key algorithm from specifications]
- Time complexity: O(n log n) for [operation]
- Space complexity: O(n) for [data structure]
- Edge cases handled: [list specific edge cases]

**Optimization Techniques**:
- Memoization for expensive calculations
- Batch processing for multiple items
- Lazy evaluation for deferred computation
- Index-based lookups for O(1) access

### 10.2 Testing Strategy

#### Unit Testing Approach

**Test Framework**: pytest with pytest-cov for coverage

**Test Organization**:
- One test file per implementation file
- Test class per implementation class
- Test method per public method
- Fixtures for common test data

**Test Coverage Goals**:
- ≥85% line coverage
- ≥90% branch coverage for critical paths
- 100% coverage for error handling code
- Property-based tests for algorithms (hypothesis library)

**Mocking Strategy**:
- Mock external dependencies (APIs, databases, message queues)
- Use dependency injection for easy mocking
- Verify mock interactions (method calls, arguments)
- Use real implementations for internal dependencies

#### Integration Testing Approach

**Test Scope**:
- End-to-end workflow validation
- Database transaction integrity
- External service integration
- Message queue publish/consume

**Test Environment**:
- Docker Compose for local test environment
- Test database with isolated schema
- Mock external services with WireMock
- Local Pub/Sub emulator for messaging

**Data Management**:
- Test fixtures for consistent test data
- Database reset between test runs
- Idempotent tests (repeatable)
- Cleanup test data after execution

#### Performance Testing Approach

**Load Testing**:
- Tool: Locust or k6 for load generation
- Scenarios: Realistic user workflows
- Ramp-up: Gradual increase from 0 to peak load
- Duration: Sustained load for 30+ minutes
- Metrics: Latency percentiles, throughput, error rate

**Stress Testing**:
- Push system beyond normal capacity
- Identify breaking point and failure modes
- Verify graceful degradation
- Test recovery after stress removal

**Profiling**:
- CPU profiling with cProfile
- Memory profiling with memory_profiler
- Identify performance bottlenecks
- Optimize hot paths

### 10.3 Deployment Strategy

#### CI/CD Pipeline

**Build Stage**:
1. Lint code (Flake8, Black, mypy)
2. Run unit tests with coverage
3. security scan dependencies (Snyk, OWASP)
4. Build container image
5. Push image to Artifact Registry

**Test Stage**:
1. Deploy to test environment
2. Run integration tests
3. Run acceptance tests (BDD scenarios)
4. Run performance tests
5. Run security tests (DAST, penetration testing)

**Deploy Stage**:
1. Deploy to staging (automatic)
2. Run smoke tests
3. Manual approval for production
4. Deploy to production (blue-green/canary)
5. Monitor health checks and alerts

#### Deployment Approach

**Blue-Green Deployment**:
- Maintain two identical production environments (blue/green)
- Deploy new version to inactive environment
- Run smoke tests on inactive environment
- Switch traffic to new version with load balancer
- Keep old version running for quick rollback

**Canary Deployment**:
- Deploy new version to small subset of instances (5-10%)
- Monitor metrics (error rate, latency) for 15-30 minutes
- Gradually increase traffic to new version (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)
- Rollback if metrics degrade
- Full rollout if metrics remain healthy

**Rollback Procedure**:
1. Detect deployment issue (monitoring alerts, manual observation)
2. Execute rollback command (`gcloud run services update-traffic --to-revisions=previous=100`)
3. Verify old version is serving traffic
4. Investigate root cause
5. Fix issue and redeploy

#### Configuration Management

**Environment Variables**:
- Loaded from `.env` files (local) or regulatoryret Manager (cloud)
- Separate configuration per environment (dev/staging/prod)
- Never commit regulatoryrets to version control
- Use Pydantic Settings for type-safe configuration

**Feature Flags**:
- LaunchDarkly or similar feature flag service
- Toggle features without code deployment
- Percentage-based rollouts
- User/organization-targeted flags
- Kill switch for problematic features

**regulatoryrets Management**:
- Google regulatoryret Manager for all regulatoryrets
- regulatoryrets mounted as environment variables or files
- Automatic rotation for credentials
- Audit logging for regulatoryret access

> 1. **Check existing artifacts**: List what upstream documents actually exist in `docs/`
> 2. **Reference only existing documents**: Use actual document IDs, not placeholders
> 3. **Use `null` appropriately**: Only when upstream artifact type genuinely doesn't exist for this feature
> 4. **Do NOT create phantom references**: Never reference documents that don't exist
> 5. **Do NOT create missing upstream artifacts**: If upstream artifacts are missing, skip that functionality. Only create functionality for existing upstream artifacts.
