# Traceability Matrix: BRD-01 through BRD-NN

## Document Control

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| Document ID | TRACEABILITY_MATRIX_BRD |
| Title | Comprehensive Business Requirements Traceability Matrix |
| Status | [Active/Draft] |
| Version | 1.0.0 |
| Date Created | YYYY-MM-DD |
| Author | [Team Name] |
| Purpose | Track bidirectional traceability for all Business Requirements Documents |


---

Note: Some examples in this document show a portable `docs/` root. In this repository, artifact folders live at the ai_dev_flow root without the `docs/` prefix; see README → “Using This Repo” for path mapping.

**⚠️ TAG-BASED AUTO-GENERATION AVAILABLE**

This traceability matrix can be automatically generated by scanning code files for @brd:, @spec:, @test: tags.

**Recommended Approach:** Use tag-based auto-discovery instead of manual maintenance.

**Generate automatically using:**
```bash
# Extract tags from all files
python scripts/extract_tags.py --source src/ docs/ tests/ --output docs/generated/tags.json

# Validate tags against documents
python scripts/validate_tags_against_docs.py --tags docs/generated/tags.json --strict

# Generate BRD traceability matrix
python scripts/generate_traceability_matrix.py --type BRD --output docs/01_BRD/BRD-00_TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Single source of truth: Tags embedded in code
- ✅ Always up-to-date: Generated from current codebase
- ✅ No manual sync: Automated validation prevents drift
- ✅ Coverage metrics: Automatically calculated

**Tag Format:** `@brd: BRD.NN.01.SS` (unified element ID format, e.g., `BRD.01.01.30`)

**Format**: TYPE.NN.TT.SS (DOC_NUM.ELEM_TYPE.SEQ) - Element type 01 = Functional Requirement

See: [TRACEABILITY.md](../TRACEABILITY.md#tag-based-auto-discovery-alternative) for complete tag-based workflow.

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Document Type Description
Business Requirements Documents (BRDs) capture strategic business objectives, stakeholder needs, market analysis, and high-level business goals that drive product development. BRDs translate strategic vision into actionable business requirements.

### 1.2 Coverage Scope
This matrix tracks traceability for all BRD documents in the project, mapping upstream sources (market research, strategic plans, stakeholder interviews) to downstream artifacts (PRD features, EARS requirements).

### 1.3 Statistics
- **Total BRDs Tracked**: [X] documents
- **Document Status**: [Y] active, [Z] superseded
- **Coverage Period**: [Start Date] to [End Date]
- **Last Updated**: YYYY-MM-DD

## 2. Required Tags (Cumulative Tagging Hierarchy - Layer 1)

### 2.1 Tag Requirements for BRD Artifacts

**Layer**: 1
**Artifact Type**: BRD (Business Requirements Document)
**Required Tags**: None (BRD is top-level artifact)
**Tag Count**: 0

### 2.2 Tag Format

BRD is Layer 1 in the cumulative tagging hierarchy and serves as the top-level artifact. **BRD documents do not require upstream traceability tags** since they represent the highest level of formal requirements documentation.

However, BRD documents should reference their strategic sources in the "Upstream Sources" section using natural language references:

```markdown
## 10. Traceability

### 2.3.1 Upstream Sources

**Strategic Source**: Market Analysis Report section 4.2 - service integration Requirements
**Business Justification**: Q4 2024 Strategic Initiative - Platform Modernization
**Stakeholder Input**: Executive Steering Committee Meeting 2024-09-15
```

### 2.3 Example: BRD with Strategic References

```markdown
# BRD-09: service integration Business Requirements

## 10. Traceability

### 2.3.2 Upstream Sources (Example)

**Required Tags** (Cumulative Tagging Hierarchy - Layer 1):
- None (BRD is top-level artifact)

**Strategic Sources**:
- Market Analysis Report section 4.2: "service integration Market Opportunity"
- Q4 2024 Strategic Plan: "Platform Modernization Initiative"
- Executive Committee Decision (2024-09-15): "Approved service integration roadmap"
- Stakeholder Interviews (2024-08-20 through 2024-09-10): provider connectivity pain points

### 2.3.3 Downstream Artifacts

**Direct Dependencies**:
- PRD.16.07.01: operation execution Product Requirements (`@brd: BRD.09.01.15`)
- PRD.17.07.01: Order Management Features (`@brd: BRD.09.01.20`)
- EARS.12.24.01: Formal operation execution requirements (`@brd: BRD.09.01.15`)
```

### 2.4 Validation Rules

1. **No Upstream Tags Required**: BRD documents do not use `@artifact-type` tags for upstream traceability
2. **Strategic Documentation**: BRDs MUST document strategic sources in natural language (Market Research, Strategic Plans, Stakeholder Input)
3. **Downstream Awareness**: BRDs SHOULD list downstream artifacts that reference them (PRDs, EARS, etc.)
4. **Tag Discovery**: All downstream artifacts MUST include `@brd: BRD.NN.01.SS` tags referencing this BRD

### 2.5 Tag Discovery

Find all artifacts that reference a specific BRD:

```bash
# Find all downstream artifacts referencing BRD-09
python scripts/extract_tags.py --find-references BRD-09

# Generate reverse traceability report
python scripts/generate_traceability_matrix.py --type BRD --show-downstream
```

### 2.6 BRD as Traceability Anchor

BRD serves as the **traceability anchor** for the entire SDD workflow:

```
Strategy (External) → BRD (Layer 1)
                        ↓
                  Downstream Artifacts Tag with @brd:
                        ↓
            PRD (Layer 2): @brd: BRD.09.01.15
                        ↓
         EARS (Layer 3): @brd: BRD.09.01.15, @prd: PRD.16.01.01...
                        ↓
         [Complete chain through Code and Tests]
```

**Key Principle**: While BRD has no upstream tags, **every downstream artifact** from PRD through Tests MUST include `@brd: BRD.NN.01.SS` tags, creating complete end-to-end traceability from business requirements to production code.

- BRD-YYY: Missing EARS formalization (business goals not formalized)
- BRD-ZZZ: Missing BDD acceptance criteria (no test scenarios defined)

**Orphaned Documents** (downstream artifacts with no BRD source):
- PRD-XXX: Product requirement with no business justification
- EARS-YYY: Formal requirement with no business context

## 12. Immediate Next Steps

### 12.1 Priority Actions

1. **Complete Missing PRD Mappings**: [X] BRDs require PRD artifacts
2. **Formalize EARS Requirements**: [Y] business requirements need EARS statements
3. **Define Acceptance Criteria**: [Z] BRDs need BDD scenarios
4. **Resolve Orphaned Artifacts**: [N] orphaned documents need BRD linkage

### 12.2 Upcoming Milestones

| Milestone | Target Date | Required BRDs | Status |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|--------|
| [Milestone 1: MVP Release] | YYYY-MM-DD | BRD-01 through BRD-05 | On Track |
| [Milestone 2: Feature Expansion] | YYYY-MM-DD | BRD-NN range | Planning |
| [Milestone 3: Market Launch] | YYYY-MM-DD | All BRDs | Not Started |

### 12.3 Quality Improvement Recommendations

- **Traceability Coverage**: Achieve 100% BRD → PRD → EARS coverage
- **Business Alignment**: Validate all BRDs align with current strategic goals
- **Stakeholder Review**: Schedule quarterly BRD review with business stakeholders
- **Documentation Quality**: Ensure all BRDs include measurable success criteria
