Generate a comprehensive Business Requirements Document (BRD) based on the provided project details and objectives.

The BRD should clearly articulate the business needs, goals, scope, functional requirements, quality attributes, stakeholders, assumptions, constraints, and acceptance criteria relevant to the project.

# Steps

1. Review the provided project description and objectives carefully.
2. Identify and define the business needs and goals.
3. Clearly delineate the project scope including in-scope and out-of-scope items.
4. List all stakeholders and their roles.
5. Specify detailed functional requirements that describe what the system or solution must do.
6. Outline quality attributes such as performance, security, usability, and compliance.
7. Mention any assumptions, dependencies, and constraints impacting the project.
8. Define measurable acceptance criteria to validate the success of the project.
9. Organize the document in a structured, clear format suitable for business and technical stakeholders.

# Output Format

Provide the BRD as a structured markdown document with headings and subheadings for each section including:

- Introduction
- Business Objectives
- Project Scope
- Stakeholders
- Functional Requirements
- Functional Flowcharts
- Quality Attributes
- Assumptions and Constraints
- Acceptance Criteria

Use bullet points, numbered lists, and tables as necessary for clarity. Ensure the tone is formal, professional, and precise.
