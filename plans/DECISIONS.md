# Decision Log

Non-obvious decisions made during the migration, with rationale, so the "why"
survives across ephemeral sessions. Newest first. Timestamps are ISO 8601 UTC.

Decisions that affect the **shared spec** graduate into `framework/governance/`
when change management returns post-Phase 5 (see `ROADMAP.md` CHG-D2).

## D-0004 — Compaction/continuity automation via hooks

- **Date:** 2026-05-18T17:27:00Z
- **Decision:** Add a `PreCompact` hook that auto-commits and pushes a WIP
  snapshot, and a `SessionStart` hook that injects `plans/HANDOFF.md` into
  context. Scripts live in `.claude/hooks/`.
- **Why:** Containers are ephemeral; only pushed work survives. The PreCompact
  hook guarantees a durable snapshot before any memory-reduction event; the
  SessionStart hook restores continuity automatically.
- **Notes:** Hooks run shell commands, not Claude reasoning — they cannot
  *write* the handoff narrative. `plans/HANDOFF.md` is refreshed manually as a
  workflow step; the hook only snapshots whatever is on disk. The PreCompact
  hook no-ops off the working branch as a safety guard.

## D-0003 — Project memory + development workflow in `CLAUDE.md`

- **Date:** 2026-05-18T00:00:00Z
- **Decision:** Maintain a root `CLAUDE.md` as auto-loaded project memory, and
  codify the change flow (plan → review → harden → implement → verify → land).
- **Why:** Each session starts cold in a fresh container. Persistent memory
  prevents re-discovery; an explicit flow keeps quality consistent.

## D-0002 — `plans/` workspace for migration tracking

- **Date:** 2026-05-18T00:00:00Z
- **Decision:** Create a fresh root `plans/` (distinct from the frozen
  `legacy/plans/`) holding `MIGRATION_TODO.md` (live tracker), `HANDOFF.md`,
  `DECISIONS.md`, and ad hoc working notes.
- **Why:** Separates volatile working state from the stable published
  `ROADMAP.md`.

## D-0001 — Isolate the pre-migration project into `legacy/`

- **Date:** 2026-05-18T00:00:00Z
- **Decision:** Move the entire pre-migration project into `legacy/` via git
  renames; freeze it (copy-don't-move); disable legacy CI.
- **Why:** A clean root for the new multi-platform structure with zero path
  overlap, while preserving the old project for content extraction in
  Phases 1–3 and full git history.
