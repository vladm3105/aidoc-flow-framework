# Decision Log

Non-obvious decisions made during the migration, with rationale, so the "why"
survives across ephemeral sessions. Newest first. Timestamps are ISO 8601 UTC.

Decisions that affect the **shared spec** graduate into `framework/governance/`
when change management returns post-Phase 5 (see `ROADMAP.md` CHG-D2).

## D-0010 — Framework docs drop legacy version-lineage content

- **Date:** 2026-05-19T10:00:00Z
- **Decision:** When extracting docs into `framework/`, drop content that only
  documents the legacy SDD version lineage — the `## v3.2 Changes from v3.0`
  sections (P1-T7, in the guide and the testing-strategy doc) and the
  `CHG_MIGRATION_PLAN.md` (v2→v3) reference in `QUICK_REFERENCE.md`.
- **Why:** `framework/` is a fresh `0.1.0` version stream (D-0006); it does not
  continue the legacy `v3.x` numbering, so "changes from v3.0" history is both
  inaccurate framing and carries `v3.x` tokens the conformance hygiene check
  bans. The current layer order/rationale those sections explained is already
  stated as present-tense fact elsewhere in each doc.
- **Notes:** Removal is limited to version-lineage framing; all genuinely
  engine-agnostic methodology content is copied verbatim.

## D-0009 — Namespaced version tags; framework tag at Phase 1 close

- **Date:** 2026-05-19T09:15:00Z
- **Decision:** Each SemVer stream tags in its own namespace — project
  milestones `vX.Y.Z`, framework spec `framework/vX.Y.Z`, platforms
  `<platform>/vX.Y.Z`. `VERSION` files hold the bare SemVer; the tag adds the
  `v` and namespace. The `framework/v0.1.0` tag is created at Phase 1 close
  (after P1-T7), not at P1-T6 — so it marks a fully assembled spec — alongside
  the `v0.2.0` project milestone.
- **Why:** `docs/PROJECT.md` defined only bare milestone tags; the independent
  framework/platform streams need distinct, collision-free tag names.
  Slash-namespaced refs let `git tag -l 'framework/*'` filter one stream.
  Tagging an incomplete spec would burn a version on a partial assembly.
- **Notes:** Convention recorded in `docs/PROJECT.md` §3 (extended, not a new
  doc). P1-T6 delivers `framework/VERSION` + the convention; the deferred tag
  is tracked as the Phase 1 close task (P1-T8).

## D-0008 — Conformance suite is stdlib-only (`unittest`)

- **Date:** 2026-05-18T21:20:00Z
- **Decision:** Build `tests/conformance/` on the Python 3.11 standard library
  (`unittest`) plus `PyYAML`. No `pytest` dependency.
- **Why:** The conformance suite is the shared, engine-agnostic contract; it
  must be runnable by any platform with zero install friction. `pytest` is not
  installed in the environment, and `python -m unittest discover` runs the
  suite anywhere. `unittest.TestCase` classes remain `pytest`-discoverable for
  platforms that prefer that runner.
- **Notes:** Discovery uses a flat package-less layout (`tests/conformance/`
  with no `__init__.py`) so test modules can `import _spec` directly under
  `unittest discover`. The plan listed an `__init__.py`; it was dropped during
  implementation for clean discovery.

## D-0007 — Plan review is a two-pass, recorded gate

- **Date:** 2026-05-18T18:45:00Z
- **Decision:** Every plan file carries a `## Review log` with **≥2**
  ISO-stamped passes; a plan may not be presented, handed off, or implemented
  until it does. New plans start from `plans/PLAN-TEMPLATE.md`. A non-blocking
  `PreToolUse(git commit)` hook warns when a staged plan file falls short.
- **Why:** The review/harden step was prose-only, so a skipped second pass was
  invisible — it happened once on the P1-T2 plan. Making each pass a named,
  checkable artifact turns a silent omission into a visible gap.
- **Notes:** The hook enforces that a pass is *recorded*, not that it is
  thoughtful — review quality stays a manual judgment step.

## D-0006 — First `framework/` spec version is `0.1.0`

- **Date:** 2026-05-18T18:00:00Z
- **Decision:** The extracted `framework/` spec starts its independent version
  stream at `0.1.0`, carrying a `derived_from: "SDD v3.2"` metadata field.
  `1.0.0` is reserved for when both platforms pass the shared conformance suite.
- **Why:** The content is mature, but as a freshly re-packaged engine-agnostic
  artifact it is not yet conformance-proven and no platform is wired to it.
  `0.x` is the honest signal; the lineage field preserves provenance.

## D-0005 — `framework/` ships per-layer index templates

- **Date:** 2026-05-18T18:00:00Z
- **Decision:** Each `framework/layers/` directory ships a
  `{TYPE}-00_index.TEMPLATE.{md,yaml}` skeleton. Legacy `*-00_index.*` instance
  files are dropped (project data, not spec).
- **Why:** The index/registry *format* is a conformance concern — both
  platforms must produce and validate index files identically. Pinning the
  format in the spec prevents platform divergence.

## D-0004 — Compaction/continuity automation via hooks

- **Date:** 2026-05-18T17:27:00Z
- **Decision:** Add a `PreCompact` hook that auto-commits and pushes a WIP
  snapshot, and a `SessionStart` hook that injects `plans/HANDOFF.md` into
  context. Scripts live in `.claude/hooks/`.
- **Why:** Containers are ephemeral; only pushed work survives. The PreCompact
  hook guarantees a durable snapshot before any memory-reduction event; the
  SessionStart hook restores continuity automatically.
- **Notes:** Hooks run shell commands, not Claude reasoning — they cannot
  *write* the handoff narrative. `plans/HANDOFF.md` is refreshed manually as a
  workflow step; the hook only snapshots whatever is on disk. The PreCompact
  hook no-ops off the working branch as a safety guard.

## D-0003 — Project memory + development workflow in `CLAUDE.md`

- **Date:** 2026-05-18T00:00:00Z
- **Decision:** Maintain a root `CLAUDE.md` as auto-loaded project memory, and
  codify the change flow (plan → review → harden → implement → verify → land).
- **Why:** Each session starts cold in a fresh container. Persistent memory
  prevents re-discovery; an explicit flow keeps quality consistent.

## D-0002 — `plans/` workspace for migration tracking

- **Date:** 2026-05-18T00:00:00Z
- **Decision:** Create a fresh root `plans/` (distinct from the frozen
  `legacy/plans/`) holding `MIGRATION_TODO.md` (live tracker), `HANDOFF.md`,
  `DECISIONS.md`, and ad hoc working notes.
- **Why:** Separates volatile working state from the stable published
  `ROADMAP.md`.

## D-0001 — Isolate the pre-migration project into `legacy/`

- **Date:** 2026-05-18T00:00:00Z
- **Decision:** Move the entire pre-migration project into `legacy/` via git
  renames; freeze it (copy-don't-move); disable legacy CI.
- **Why:** A clean root for the new multi-platform structure with zero path
  overlap, while preserving the old project for content extraction in
  Phases 1–3 and full git history.
