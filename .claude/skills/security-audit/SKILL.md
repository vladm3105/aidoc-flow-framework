## Security Testing

### Authentication Testing

```python
# Test: Weak password allowed
def test_weak_password_rejected():
    result = register_user(username="test", password="123")
    assert result.error == "Password too weak"

# Test: JWT token validation
def test_invalid_jwt_rejected():
    response = api_call(headers={"Authorization": "Bearer invalid_token"})
    assert response.status_code == 401

# Test: Session expiration
def test_session_expires():
    token = login_user()
    time.sleep(3600)  # Wait 1 hour
    response = api_call(headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {token}"})
    assert response.status_code == 401
```

### Authorization Testing

```python
# Test: User cannot access admin endpoint
def test_user_cannot_access_admin():
    user_token = login_as_user()
    response = api_call("/admin", headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {user_token}"})
    assert response.status_code == 403

# Test: User cannot access other user's data
def test_user_data_isolation():
    user1_token = login_as_user("user1")
    response = api_call("/users/user2/profile", headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {user1_token}"})
    assert response.status_code == 403
```

### Injection Testing

```python
# Test: SQL injection prevented
def test_sql_injection_prevented():
    malicious_input = "admin' OR '1'='1"
    result = get_user(username=malicious_input)
    assert result is None  # Should not return admin user

# Test: XSS prevented
def test_xss_prevented():
    malicious_script = "<script>alert('XSS')</script>"
    response = create_comment(text=malicious_script)
    assert "<script>" not in response.html
    assert "&lt;script&gt;" in response.html  # Properly escaped
```

## Security Metrics

### Vulnerability Metrics

```
Vulnerability Density = Total Vulnerabilities / KLOC
Target: <5 vulnerabilities per 1000 lines of code

Critical Vulnerability Count
Target: 0

Mean Time to Remediate (MTTR)
- Critical: <24 hours
- High: <7 days
- Medium: <30 days
- Low: <90 days
```

### Security Coverage

```
Security Test Coverage = (Security Tests / Total Tests) × 100%
Target: ≥20%

Security Requirement Coverage = (Implemented / Total) × 100%
Target: 100% for MUST requirements

Dependency Vulnerability Coverage = (Scanned Deps / Total Deps) × 100%
Target: 100%
```

---

## Tool Access

Required tools:
- `Read`: Read code, configurations, requirements
- `Bash`: Execute security scanning tools
- `Grep`: Search for security patterns
- `Glob`: Find files to scan

Required software:
- bandit: Python SAST
- safety: Dependency scanning
- semgrep: Semantic code analysis
- trivy: Container scanning
- checkov: IaC scanning
- gitleaks: Secret detection

---

## Integration Points

### With doc-flow
- Validate security requirements in REQ documents
- Check security traceability (REQ → Implementation)
- Generate security documentation

### With code-review
- Share vulnerability findings
- Coordinate security fixes
- Track security metrics

### With test-automation
- Generate security test cases
- Validate security controls
- Track security test coverage

### With devops-flow

---

## Best Practices

1. **Shift left**: Security testing early in development
2. **Defense in depth**: Multiple security layers
3. **Least privilege**: Minimal access by default
4. **Fail securely**: Secure defaults on errors
5. **Keep it simple**: Complexity is enemy of security
6. **Assume breach**: Plan for compromise
7. **Zero trust**: Verify everything
8. **Security by design**: Not an afterthought
9. **Regular audits**: Continuous security assessment
10. **Incident response**: Plan and test response procedures

---

## Limitations

1. Cannot detect all vulnerability types (e.g., business logic flaws)
2. May produce false positives (requires manual review)
3. Depends on tool database currency
4. Cannot test runtime behavior fully
5. Limited threat modeling automation

---

## Success Criteria

- Zero critical vulnerabilities in production
- <5 high severity vulnerabilities
- 100% security requirement coverage
- All dependencies with no known CVEs
- No secrets in code repository
- Security score ≥80/100
- OWASP Top 10 coverage: 10/10

---

## Notes

- Security audits run automatically in CI/CD
- Critical vulnerabilities block deployment
- Vulnerability reports saved to `reports/security/`
- Monthly comprehensive security review recommended
- Penetration testing recommended quarterly
- Security training for development team required
