# BRD Index (Business Requirements Documents)

Purpose

- Central index for Business Requirements Documents (BRDs).
- Tracks allocation and sequencing for `BRD-NNN_{descriptive}.md` descriptors.

Allocation Rules

- Numbering: allocate sequentially starting at `001`; keep numbers stable.
- BRDs define high-level business objectives, market context, and strategic goals.
- Each BRD should link to downstream PRDs that translate business requirements into product features.
- BRDs are typically created during initial project planning and major strategic initiatives.

Document Organization

- BRDs focus on the "why" and "what" from a business perspective
- Include market analysis, stakeholder needs, success metrics, and constraints
- Avoid technical implementation details (those belong in downstream documents)

Templates

- [BRD-template.md](./BRD-template.md): Comprehensive BRD template with detailed sections
- [BRD-template-2.md](./BRD-template-2.md): Alternative BRD format
- [BRD-trading-template.md](./BRD-trading-template.md): Trading-specific BRD template
